In winter's Christmas tragedy 


Above and beyond melancoly, 
A young man plays on, 
The piano resonates, yet a sound remains, 
The sound of dashing memory, 
Of a sweet lovely christmas charol... 

Deep in the dark, 
As snow gently falls, 
As the clouds shine bright, 
A cold shiver from dusty winds, 
In winter's christmas tragedy...
